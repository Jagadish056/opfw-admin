            "INVINCIBILITY"            => "Impossible to be scuff. Invincibility can only be toggled through script. We keep track of every time the framework toggles your invincibility on/off. If you are found invincible outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

A few mod menus use runtime textures to display things like their logo. We have a list of known runtime textures used by mod menus. If one of those textures is loaded, that means you had to have used some script that loaded it.",

All of the frameworks blips like PD/EMS trackers, etc. are created through a different method. If you have blips for players locations on your map, you had to have used some script to create them.",

If you are found frozen outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so. Freezing the player is common during noclip for example, to prevent you from constantly falling.",

If your health or max health is found to be different than 200, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

This detection watches if you are trying to clear another players tasks. Mod menus sometimes do that to kick other players out of their vehicles for example. If you are found trying to clear another players tasks, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",
            "ILLEGAL_NATIVE"           => "Impossible to be scuff. A native is a function that is built into the game. You can only call natives through script. We keep track of a list of natives like creating a vehicle, trying to force ownership of an entity, etc. We don't use any of those natives in the framework, so if you are found calling one of them, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

If you are found calling one of those honeypots, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

Through script you can create different cameras to for example freecam around. We keep track of every time the framework creates a camera. If you are found with a camera created outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so. Very rarely the game creates a different camera natively, but we have exceptions for those. This detection has been literally 100% accurate so far and even caught a closet cheater.",

If your client registers one of those commands, this detection will trigger. Since we look for the command being registered and not being used, this detection is basically impossible to be scuff, since commands can only be registered through script.",

            "ILLEGAL_VEHICLE_MODIFIER" => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Vehicle modifiers are used to for example increase your vehicles gravity, top speed, acceleration, etc. We keep track of every time the framework uses any of those modifiers. If you are found using one of those modifiers outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so. Very rarely those modifiers differ natively but we reset them every time you switch vehicles.",
            "WEAPON_SPAWN"             => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. The framework gives and removes weapons from your ped depending on what weapon you are trying to or have currently equipped. If you are trying to give yourself a weapon different to the one you currently have equipped, you had to have done so through script or a menu. When an armed ped dies it sometimes drops its weapon and when you pick it up you are theoretically giving yourself a weapon. However we have exceptions for those cases and usually remove all dropped weapons almost instantly.",
            "PED_CHANGE"               => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. You can only change your ped through script. We keep track of every time the framework changes or modifies your ped. For example when spawning in, changing and taking off clothes. If you are found changing your ped outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so. Your ped can change natively in some rare occasions but we have exceptions for all of those cases.",
            "THERMAL_NIGHTVISION"      => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Thermal and night vision can only be toggled through script. We keep track of every time the framework toggles your thermal/night vision on/off. If you are found with thermal/night vision on outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so. When using a night-vision / thermal scope you are also toggling your thermal/night vision on/off, but we have exceptions for those cases.",
            "HOTWIRE_DRIVING"          => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. When you haven't hotwired a car and you don't have keys to it, the framework forcefully turns the engine off every single frame. This detection checks if your engine has been running continuously for a certain period of time, while having to hotwire a car. Some mod menus have the ability to override the state of a vehicles engine, basically bypassing the hotwire system. If you are found driving a car without hotwiring it, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",
            "SUSPICIOUS_EXPLOSION"     => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. There is a bunch of different explosion types modders use to blow people up. Those explosions do occur natively but they have specific metadata attached to them making it somewhat easy to differentiate between native explosions and ones that were manually created through script or a menu.",
            "UNDERGROUND"              => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. When teleporting, some mod menus will place your ped very far below the ground and then move it to the target to avoid being detected by anti-cheats. This detection tracks the distance you've traveled while being far below the ground. If you are found to have traveled a certain distance while being far below the ground, you probably used a menu to do so.",
            "ILLEGAL_DAMAGE"           => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Every time you deal damage to another player you do so through the server (You -> Server -> Other player). When you do so, we check a variety of things like: Do you have the weapon you are trying to damage with? Is the damage much higher than expected for that weapon? Etc. If any of those checks fail, you are probably modding. The metadata of this detection will contain a lot more information.",
            "VEHICLE_MODIFICATION"     => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Things like a vehicles engine level, breaks, transmission, turbo, etc. can only be changed through script. We keep track of every time the framework changes any of those values. If you are found changing any of those values outside of those times, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",
            "ADVANCED_NOCLIP"          => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Certain noclip scripts are able to sneak past our other detections by not freezing the player ped or using a script camera. However most of those scripts will have the player move in the direction the camera is facing. This detection checks if the W key is pressed and the player just moved in the exact same direction as the camera is facing. If this happens continuously for a certain period of time and a few other checks are met, you are most likely using a noclip script.",
            "ILLEGAL_LOCAL_VEHICLE"    => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Every entity in the game can be either networked or not networked. If it is networked it is visible to all players. If it is not-networked, the entity only exist on your client. Vehicles that are driven around should never be not-networked, since all ambient vehicles (ones that are spawned natively by the game) and all vehicles spawned in by the framework are networked. If you are found driving a not-networked vehicle, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to spawn said vehicle in, since there is no other way to get a drivable not-networked vehicle.",
            "HANDLING_FIELD"           => "Highly unlikely to be scuff. Some menus have the ability to override individual fields in the handling.meta of a vehicle. This can be used to change a vehicle's handling, making it super fast, stick to the ground, etc. Handling for vehicles is determined by the handling.meta file for said vehicle. The only script in the entire framework that dynamically overrides handling fields is the tuner-chip, however we have exceptions for that case. Handling fields can only be changed dynamically through script, so if you are found changing any of those values, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

            "BAD_ENTITY_SPAWN"         => "Very unlikely to be scuff. Every object in the game has a bunch of metadata attached to it. Objects spawned through script can be pretty reliably differentiated from natives ones through said metadata. In addition to that, we also have a bunch of other checks to verify an entity was spawned through script. All of the objects spawned by the framework are spawned on the server-side, so if you are found spawning an object on the client-side, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",
            "PED_SPAWN"                => "Very unlikely to be scuff. Every ped in the game has a bunch of metadata attached to it. Peds spawned through script can be pretty reliably differentiated from natives ones through said metadata. In addition to that, we also have a bunch of other checks to verify an entity was spawned through script. All of the peds spawned by the framework are spawned on the server-side, so if you are found spawning a ped on the client-side, you had to have injected some script or used a menu to do so.",

            "FAST_MOVEMENT"            => "Very unlikely to be scuff. This detection tracks how quickly you move around. It calculates the maximum distance you should be able to travel given your speed (plus a small buffer) to detect if you noclip or teleport. There are a variety of checks ensuring players don't get banned for false positives, however they can still happen. This detection saved a bunch of metadata like the maximum speed you traveled and how much further than expected you traveled. When unsure about a ban by this detection, check the historic live-map, metadata and attached screen recording for that player.",
            "DISTANCE_TAZE"            => "Very unlikely to be scuff. All tasers used in-game have a very limited range. A lot of mod menus give modders the ability to tase someone much further away. If you are found tasing someone from a distance that is impossible to do normally, you most likely did so through script or a menu. Since the server can lag, there is a very small chance for this to be a false positive but we allow for quite a bit of leeway, so it is incredibly unlikely.",
            "SEMI_GODMODE"             => "Very unlikely to be scuff. To avoid detection, a lot of mod menus offer so called semi-godmode. Compared to straight up invincibility, this works by continuously resetting your health and/or armor to full. So every time you receive damage, you would be healed almost instantly. We track if your health does not decrease when taking damage. If you are continuously not taking damage, you are most likely using semi-godmode.",
            "INFINITE_AMMO"            => "Very unlikely to be scuff. We track how much ammo should be in your weapons magazine. Every time you shoot we subtract from that value. If you shoot a lot more bullets than are in your magazine without reloading in between, you are most likely using some kind of menu to give yourself infinite ammo.",
            "TELEPORTED"               => "Very unlikely to be scuff. We keep track of your current position and the last position. If your current position is all the sudden very far away from your last position, you are most likely teleporting. We keep track of most cases where this would happen legitimately to avoid false positives, but there is a small chance for this to be a false positive. If you are unsure about this ban, check the historic live-map, metadata and attached screen recording.",

            "BAD_SCREEN_WORD"          => "Unlikely to be scuff. Every 5 or so seconds, we take a screenshot of your game. If you have a menu on your screen for example, it would be visible in that screenshot. Those screenshots are then analyzed by AI to extract any visible text. We have a huge wordlist of common words and phrases used in mod menus (Things like \"Godmode\", \"Give Money\", etc.). If any of those words are found in the screenshot, you are most likely using a menu. Since the game is open world and supposed to mimic real life, there are things like traffic signs, billboards, etc. that could potentially contain those words. However, we have a bunch of checks and exceptions to avoid triggering false positives. The attached screenshot should be pretty clear if it is or isn't a mod menu.",
